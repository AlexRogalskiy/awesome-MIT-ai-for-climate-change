# awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)
**Awesome-MIT-AI-for-Climate-Change** is a curated list of professors and other researchers at MIT who are tackling climate change with machine learning (CCML)

Finding professors in machine learning and climate change is difficult, because they are spread across various departments and research a wide breadth of optics. Whether you're applying for graduate school, look for collaborators, or inspiring projects - this list is intended to get you started by finding the right people.

This is a safe, open, and inclusive community; please add your favorite professors through commenting in an issue or creating a pull request.
